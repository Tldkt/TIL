**✔characteristics of object-oriented programming**

**Encapsulation** 

Encapsulation is capturing data and keeping it safely and securely from outside interfaces.

**Inheritance**

This is the process by which a class can be derived from a base class with all features of base class and some of its own. This increases code reusability.

**Polymorphism**

This is the ability to exist in various forms. For example an operator can be overloaded so as to add two integer numbers and two floats.

**Abstraction**

The ability to represent data at a very conceptual level without any details.
